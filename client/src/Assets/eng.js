Computers and numbers are my friends. My first field of study was engineering. I have a degree in Civil Engineering and it gave me a solid foundation for everything else I learned. Next degree (that I obtained alongside with engineering) was fitness. I love movement and biomechanics as much as mathematics (there is math everywhere, you know!). After graduating I found my dream job. It was with people who I admire, in a very creative an inspirational fitness studio. I worked there for 10 years. I trained hundreds of people. During this time I also graduated again and got masters degree in nutrition science. My love for computers and numbers never went away though, thats why right now I spend my free time learning coding and developing software. I hope now you know a little more about me!"
